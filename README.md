# bubble_sort_py

## About Implementation

This implementation of bubble sort takes an array of numbers and will iteratre through the second number up until the end of the array to check for values.

At each iteration it checks if the element one prior to the current iteration is larger than the current iteration and swaps them. This also reduces the index you iterate to at each iteration of the array.

To run test on this function run:
`sh test.sh`
